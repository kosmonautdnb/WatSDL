Some functions for emulating the SDL2 on FreeDos / WatcomC++  

SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) original repository:  
https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL.git  
  
Not final, just in the making. And perhaps very clumsy and cheesy at the moment. And justly WatcomC++ 11.0 is twice the slow as DJGPP the heck, too. You need a fast setup for this. (So it's actually just an attempt to convert Tyrian at the moment.) 

But wait:  

OpenTyrian is compiling and running/fully playable with it already.  

OpenTyrian source code and compile instructions are in tyrian.zip.  

It's also running with Watcom C++ 11 (the one before OpenWatcom).

OpenTyrians original repository:  
https://github.com/opentyrian/opentyrian.git  

And we got YapeSDL up and running. The famous C64/Plus4 emulator now on FreeDOS. But slow due to WatcomC++ and no hardware accelerations.

Raptor is also included (the SDL Reverse Engineered Port by skynettx not the original DOS Raptor in his repositories.)

NeverBall can be found here:  
https://github.com/Neverball/neverball.git  
(NvrSrc.zip is the WatcomC11 port of NeverBall. You need the data files of NeverBall Version 1.7.0 (including .sol files) to be found here  
https://github.com/Neverball/neverball/releases/tag/1.7.0-alpha.3  (you'll need just the data/ folder)  
And LibJPEG(jpegsr6.zip), LibPNGG(lpng1259.zip) and ZLib(zlib121.zip) (you need the headers and object files for NeverBall on Dos, .obj's can be generated by WatcomC11)  
NeverBall may be tough to compile due to missing libs(jpeg,png,zlib) however it's actually not meant to be compiled this way, use the above original repositories link to compile it on Windows,MacOS, Linux and alikes. I hope the authors don't oppose this DOS compile here.  

**The timer seems sometimes to be a bit misaligned to the OS file system timer after starting SDL apps. I didn't found a workaround for this, yet. To be done.**
