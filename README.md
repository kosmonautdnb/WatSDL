# WatSDL
Some functions for emulating the SDL2 on FreeDos / WatcomC++  

SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) original repository:  
https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL.git  
  
Not final, just in the making. And perhaps very clumsy and cheesy at the moment. And justly WatcomC++ 11.0 is twice the slow as DJGPP the heck, too. You need a fast setup for this. (So it's actually just an attempt to convert Tyrian at the moment.) 

But wait:  

OpenTyrian is compiling and running/fully playable with it already.  

OpenTyrian source code and compile instructions are in tyrian.zip.  

It's also running with Watcom C++ 11 (the one before OpenWatcom).

And we got YapeSDL up and running. The famous C64/Plus4 emulator now on FreeDOS. But slow due to WatcomC++ and no hardware accelerations.

**You need PMODEW(in the zip) instead of Dos4gw in order to get the keyboard and timers working**
