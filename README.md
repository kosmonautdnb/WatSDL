# WatSDL
Some functions for emulating the SDL2 on FreeDos / WatcomC++  
  
Not final, just in the making. And perhaps very clumsy and cheesy at the moment.  

But wait:  

OpenTyrian is compiling and running with it already.  

OpenTyrian source code and compile instructions are in tyrian.zip.  

OpenTyrians original repository:  
https://github.com/opentyrian/opentyrian.git

It's also running with Watcom C++ 11 (the one before OpenWatcom).

**You need PMODEW(in the zip) instead of Dos4gw in order to get the keyboard working**
