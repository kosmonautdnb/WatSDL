# WatSDL
Some functions for emulating the SDL2 on FreeDos / WatcomC++  

**You currently need PMODEW(in the zip) instead of the standard WatcomC Dos4GW in order to get the KEYBOARD and TIMERS working, PMODEW also features 256MB of memory instead of the 32MB of Dos4GW**

Not final, just in the making. And perhaps very clumsy and cheesy at the moment. And justly WatcomC++ 11.0 is twice the slow as DJGPP the heck, too. You need a fast setup for this. (So it's actually just an attempt to convert Tyrian at the moment.) 

But wait:  

OpenTyrian is compiling and running/fully playable with it already.  

OpenTyrian source code and compile instructions are in tyrian.zip.  

It's also running with Watcom C++ 11 (the one before OpenWatcom).

And we got YapeSDL up and running. The famous C64/Plus4 emulator now on FreeDOS. But slow due to WatcomC++ and no hardware accelerations.

Raptor is also included (the SDL Reverse Engineered Port by skynettx not the original DOS Raptor in his repositories.)
